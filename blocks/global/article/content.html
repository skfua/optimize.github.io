    One of the turning points for the European LCS and team SK was the emerging of a mysterious
    analyst. Owing much to him, a pretty young and not too coordinated team rose from the 8th
    position and became the silver prize-winner of this spring's season and is now considered one of
    the favorites for the summer season.

  <p><b>Olsior:</b>Hello, Incarnati0n!</p>
  <p>
    First of all, can you introduce yourself? This question is kinda standard, but it's quite special in
    regard to amount of your akas. How should people call you right now â€” Incarnation, Veigodx,
    Wizikx or just Nicolaj Jensen?
  </p>
  <p><b>Incarnati0n:</b>Hey, my name's Nicolaj Jensen.</p>
  <p>
    Most people know me as Incarnati0n (or Apdo Dog2 on EUW), glad you asked me to do this
    interview!

  <blockquote>
    I never give up, 15k gold deficit come-back's
    aren't anomalies in solo queue aren't anomalies.<span>SoloQ</span>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    And that is probably the main reason for conflicts in SoloQ, right? Someone is trying to win in 15k
    deficit game, and someone feels the game is lost, when he gives fb. What were your thoughts
    about this situation when you joined League, and how did it change throughtout the time you play
    League of Legends?
